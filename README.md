# spotgone
wdmvv/spot-on but in go because prev version sucks!
<br>
probably project structure sucks, sorry
<br>
everything will probably be based on wdmvv/spoton but with manual parsing? or maybe yt-dlp rewrite (ill prob stick with yt-dlp binary and manual parsing)
<br>
TODO:<br>
<ul>
<li>Add contexts</li>
<li>ffmpeg & yt-dlp parsing and python aka 2 versions</li>
<li>metadata inserter</li>
<li>...and some other original spoton features</li>
</ul>
